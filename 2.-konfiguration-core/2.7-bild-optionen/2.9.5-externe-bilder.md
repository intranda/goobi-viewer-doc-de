# 2.11.5 Externe Bilder

FIXME

URL patterns for external image urls which should be served via the contentServner All image urls \(= page filenames in SOLR\) which match one of the externalContent.restrictedUrls.urls Will not be delivered to the client directly, but rather embedded within a contentServer IIIF url, so the actual image is requested by the viewer/contentServer and not the client

```markup
<viewer>
    <externalContent>
        <restrictedUrls>
            <url>https?://external/restricted/.*</url>
            <url>https?://external/noaccess/.*\.tif</url>
        </restrictedUrls>
    </externalContent>
</viewer>
```
